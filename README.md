## Who Am I?

Hello!

I'm BÃ¡rbara, I'm 41 years old and a technology enthusiast. I am currently focused on enhancing my skills in Full Stack development. I am at the beginning of several projects in the field, dedicating all my time and energy to learning and building new experiences.

My professional journey began in Physiotherapy, where I worked for 18 years. During this time, I developed valuable problem-solving skills and attention to detail, which I now enthusiastically apply to software development. The transition to technology has been an exciting journey, where I love connecting with other professionals in the field and exploring new opportunities that this dynamic field offers.

At the moment, I am involved in developing a shop website in collaboration with friends, which will serve as an important project in my portfolio. We are using various technologies such as Java, React, CSS, HTML, Docker, and Spring Boot. This experience has been extremely rewarding and challenging, providing a deep understanding of the nuances of web development.
<h3>Volunteer Project</h3>
<p>
  Currently, I am part of the volunteer project "Project 4 Pozi Arad", where we are creating a website for the abandoned animals in a shelter to help with adoption.

   Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to sharing knowledge and experiences with you!
