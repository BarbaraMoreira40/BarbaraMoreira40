## About Me: 

Hello!

🌍 I'm Bárbara (from Brazil), 41 years old, and a few years ago, I decided to change my life and embark on a new journey as a backpacker, choosing to live a free and more unconventional lifestyle (🛫 currently in Europe).

👩🏽‍💻 I'm a technology enthusiast, and currently, my focus has shifted to Data Engineering. I am diving deep into this field, dedicating all my time and energy to learning about data pipelines, ETL processes, and big data technologies.

My professional journey began in Physiotherapy, where I worked for 18 years. Transitioning to technology, specifically Data Engineering, has been an exciting and challenging journey. I love connecting with professionals in the field and exploring the vast opportunities this dynamic area offers.

I am also involved in some development projects, including an online store website that I’m building with friends using technologies like Java, React, CSS, HTML, Docker, and Spring Boot. Additionally, I am creating a website for an animal shelter in Romania. These experiences have not only enhanced my skills but have also provided me with practical knowledge that I look forward to applying in my Data Engineering career.

<h4>
   Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to sharing knowledge and experiences with you!
